# coding_style

- Always prefer simple solutions
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible.
- Write code considering dev, test, and prod environments.
- Only make changes requested or well-understood.
- Avoid introducing new patterns during bugfixes unless necessary.
- Keep codebase clean and organized.
- Avoid writing one-time scripts in project files.
- Avoid files exceeding 200-300 lines. Refactor instead.
- Only mock data for tests, never for dev or prod.
- Never overwrite .env files without confirmation.
