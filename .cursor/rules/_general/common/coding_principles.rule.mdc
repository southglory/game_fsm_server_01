# General Coding Principles

- Use early-return to handle edge cases first.
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals.
- Use meaningful variable names, with boolean flags prefixed by is_, has_, can_.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies; introduce libraries only when justified.
- Project-wide logging should be structured (e.g., dict or json), not print().
