# Python Style Guide

- Follow PEP8.
- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use type hints for all functions and methods.
- Use docstrings for all public functions and classes.
- Avoid unnecessary parentheses.
- Use list comprehensions instead of map/filter when clearer.
- Limit lines to 79~100 characters.
