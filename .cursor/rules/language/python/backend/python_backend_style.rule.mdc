# Backend Development (FastAPI)

- Organize code into: routers/, services/, schemas/, utils/.
- Validate all request/response bodies with Pydantic BaseModel.
- Use FastAPI's Depends() to inject services and dependencies.
- Business logic must reside in service layer, not directly in routers.
- Always specify response_model in route decorators.
- Use async def for I/O-bound operations (DB, external APIs).
- Handle errors with HTTPException and middleware-based error handlers.
