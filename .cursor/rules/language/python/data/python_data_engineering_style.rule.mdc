# Data Engineering

- Design ETL as explicit extract(), transform(), load() stages.
- Avoid full-memory loading of large datasets, use streaming/batching.
- Validate input data schema as early as possible.
- Use parameterized SQL queries to avoid SQL Injection.
- Log data anomalies and processing statistics systematically.
- Use vectorized operations in Pandas when applicable.
