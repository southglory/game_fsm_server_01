# Application Development Guidelines

- Use main-guard (`if __name__ == "__main__":`) only for CLI or entrypoint scripts.
- Externalize business logic from CLI / GUI layer into separate modules.
- Organize code as packages when exceeding trivial script size.
- For I/O-heavy logic (video, image, filesystem) handle exceptions and edge cases explicitly.
- Use OOP only when modeling stateful entities; prefer pure functions elsewhere.
- Logging should be structured (dict or json format), avoid using print().
